# ICC curves for 2 group, 
# DIF nonuniform -> shift of curve, on high levels advantage on low levels not (pos+neg DIF) -> crossing lines
# DIF uniform -> strength of conditional dependence constant, consistent advantage

# Mean across item and group, differences may give insight 
# Differences in Variance of the scores!

# Random error -> differences between expected observation and actual observation (true score)
# Systematic error -> consistent differences between groups. Unrelated to proficiency and construct
